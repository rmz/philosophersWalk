# philosophersWalk
In the physical world, a philosopher's walk is a path in a natural environment meant for contemplation and discussion.  The VR app Philosopher's Walk is an alpha trial for a developing series that presents virtual environments where users can wander about and listen to prominent philosophical works.

This repo is a 2019.2.19f1 Unity project built on MacOS and may not transfer correctly to PC.  You will need to install the Oculus Integration package from the Unity Asset Store (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022).  The Oculus package is necessary for it's VR tools as this project combines Oculus VR with VRTK. When it asks you if you want to upgrade the OVR plugin, let it do so and restart Unity.  (Note that the project uses the legacy XR settings, which will not be supported in Unity 2020 and beyond.)

Also missing from this project is a Polygon Nature package that may not be freely distributed.  One may use any 3D object or terrain in place of the island game objects. The Environment-SimpleIslands scene uses Unity 3d primitives for the islands.

Bottom line, this is not the entire Unity project ready to go, but rather pieces to build upon.
