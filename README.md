# philosophersWalk
In the physical world, a philosopher's walk is a path in a natural environment meant for contemplation and discussion.  The VR app Philosopher's Walk is an alpha prototype for a developing series that presents virtual environments where users can wander about and listen to prominent philosophical works.

This is a Unity project (most recently tested with version 2019.3.6f1). In order for it to run you will need to install the Oculus Integration package from the Unity Asset Store (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022). When it asks you if you want to upgrade the OVR plugin, let it do so and restart Unity. This project uses the Oculus integration along with VRTK to implement VR interactions. Note that the project uses the legacy XR settings, which will not be supported in Unity 2020 and beyond.

Also missing from this project is a Polygon Nature package that may not be freely distributed.  One may use any 3D object or terrain in place of the island game objects. The Environment-SimpleIslands scene uses Unity 3d primitives for the islands.
